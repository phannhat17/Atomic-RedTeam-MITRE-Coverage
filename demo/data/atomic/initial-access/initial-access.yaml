        Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006) and [VNC](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/005) can also be used externally.(Citation: MacOS VNC software for Remote Desktop)

        Access to [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.

        Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.(Citation: Trend Micro Exposed Docker Server)(Citation: Unit 42 Hildegard Malware)

        such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files.
        Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the

        email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions

        Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways can be used to detect spearphishing with malicious attachments in transit. Detonation chambers may also be used to identify malicious attachments. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct attachments in a way to avoid these systems.

        Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing)

        Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and attachments as they're scanned to be stored on the email server or on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the attachment is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning Powershell.exe) for techniques such as [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203) or usage of malicious scripts.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.

        Mobile devices may also be used to infect PCs with malware if connected via USB.(Citation: Exploiting Smartphone USB ) This infection may be achieved using devices (Android, iOS, etc.) and, in some instances, USB charging cables.(Citation: Windows Malware Infecting Android)(Citation: iPhone Charging Cable Hack) For example, when a smartphone is connected to a system, it may appear to be mounted similar to a USB-connected disk drive. If malware that is compatible with the connected system is on the mobile device, the malware could infect the machine (especially if Autorun features are enabled).

      name: Spearphishing Attachment
      description: |-
        Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution.

        There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.

      x_mitre_detection: |-
        Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways can be used to detect spearphishing with malicious attachments in transit. Detonation chambers may also be used to identify malicious attachments. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct attachments in a way to avoid these systems.

        Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and attachments as they're scanned to be stored on the email server or on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing can potentially detect malicious events once the attachment is opened (such as a Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning Powershell.exe) for techniques such as [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203) and [Scripting](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1064).

      description: |-
        Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship abuses an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.

        Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider's access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such, [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.(Citation: CISA IT Service Providers)

        In Office 365 environments, organizations may grant Microsoft partners or resellers delegated administrator permissions. By compromising a partner or reseller account, an adversary may be able to leverage existing delegated administrator relationships or send new delegated administrator offers to clients in order to gain administrative control over the victim tenant.(Citation: Office 365 Delegated Administration)

        target before conducting an operation, especially if the trusted relationship
        is based on IT services. Adversaries may be able to act quickly towards an
        objective, so proper monitoring for behavior related to Credential Access,
        Lateral Movement, and Collection will be important to detect the intrusion.

      description: "Adversaries may send phishing messages to gain access to victim
        systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering.
        Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific
        individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally,
        adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam
        campaigns.\n\nAdversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments
        or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing
        may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms.
        Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as
        a trusted source, as well as evasive techniques such as removing or manipulating
        emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send
        messages (e.g., [Email Hiding Rules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/008)).(Citation:
        Microsoft OAuth Spam 2022)(Citation: Palo Alto Unit 42 VBA Infostealer 2014)
        Another way to accomplish this is by forging or spoofing(Citation: Proofpoint-spoof)
        the identity of the sender which can be used to fool both the human recipient
        as well as automated security tools.(Citation: cyberproof-double-bounce) \n\nVictims
        may also receive phishing messages that instruct them to call a phone number
        where they are directed to visit a malicious URL, download malware,(Citation:
        sygnia Luna Month)(Citation: CISA Remote Monitoring and Management Software)

        Network intrusion detection systems and email gateways can be used to detect phishing with malicious attachments in transit. Detonation chambers may also be used to identify malicious attachments. Solutions can be signature and behavior based, but adversaries may construct attachments in a way to avoid these systems.

        Filtering based on DKIM+SPF or header analysis can help detect when the email sender is spoofed.(Citation: Microsoft Anti Spoofing)(Citation: ACSC Email Spoofing)

        URL inspection within email (including expanding shortened links) can help detect links leading to known malicious sites. Detonation chambers can be used to detect these links and either automatically go to these sites to determine if they're potentially malicious, or wait and capture the content if a user visits the link.

        Because most common third-party services used for phishing via service leverage TLS encryption, SSL/TLS inspection is generally required to detect the initial communication/delivery. With SSL/TLS inspection intrusion detection signatures or other security gateway appliances may be able to detect malware.

        Anti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files that are downloaded on the user's computer. Many possible detections of follow-on behavior may take place once [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) occurs.

        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop.(Citation: volexity_0day_sophos_FW) Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.

        In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.(Citation: CISA MFA PrintNightmare)

        The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.(Citation: TechNet Credential Theft)

        Configure robust, consistent account activity audit policies across the enterprise and with externally accessible services.(Citation: TechNet Audit Policy) Look for suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts, either user, admin, or service accounts. Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).

        Perform regular audits of domain and local system accounts to detect accounts that may have been created by an adversary for persistence. Checks on these accounts could also include whether default accounts such as Guest have been activated. These audits should also include checks on any appliances and applications for default credentials or SSH keys, and if any are discovered, they should be updated immediately.

      name: Spearphishing via Service
      description: "Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing.
        It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use
        of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels.
        \n\nAll forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering
        targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario,
        adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal
        webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services. These services are
        more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with
        most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target
        or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create fake social
        media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing
        so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software
        that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links
        or attachments through these services.\n\nA common example is to build rapport
        with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service
        that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass
        some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely
        to open the file since it's something they were expecting. If the payload
        doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications
        and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working."

        malware. \n\nAnti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files
        that are downloaded on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing

        Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, networking hardware, or other computing devices into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. Rather than just connecting and distributing payloads via removable storage (i.e. [Replication Through Removable Media](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1091)), more robust hardware additions can be used to introduce new functionalities and/or features into a system that can then be abused.

        While public references of usage by threat actors are scarce, many red teams/penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access. Commercial and open source products can be leveraged with capabilities such as passive network tapping, network traffic modification (i.e. [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557)), keystroke injection, kernel memory reading via DMA, addition of new wireless access to an existing network, and others.(Citation: Ossmann Star Feb 2011)(Citation: Aleks Weapons Nov 2015)(Citation: Frisk DMA August 2016)(Citation: McMillan Pwn March 2012)

      name: Drive-by Compromise
      description: "Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting
        a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's
        web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also
        use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring [Application
        Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001).\n\nMultiple
        ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist (i.e., [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004)),
        including:\n\n* A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have
        injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site
        scripting\n* Script files served to a legitimate website from a publicly writeable
        cloud storage bucket are modified by an adversary\n* Malicious ads are paid
        for and served through legitimate ad providers (i.e., [Malvertising](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008))\n*
        Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any
        other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a
        script that executes on the visiting client (e.g. forum posts, comments, and
        other user controllable web content).\n\nOften the website used by an adversary
        is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry,
        or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users
        based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred
        to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known
        examples of this occurring.(Citation: Shadowserver Strategic Web Compromise)\n\nTypical
        drive-by compromise process:\n\n1. A user visits a website that is used to
        host the adversary controlled content.\n2. Scripts automatically execute,
        typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially
        vulnerable version. \n    * The user may be required to assist in this process
        by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog
        boxes.\n3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to
        the browser.\n4. If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary
        code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.\n
        \   * In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is
        required before exploit code is delivered.\n\nUnlike [Exploit Public-Facing
        Application](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190), the focus of this
        technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website.
        This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network
        instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.\n\nAdversaries may also
        use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed
        to [Steal Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528)s,
        like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information.
        These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate
        websites.(Citation: Volexity OceanLotus Nov 2017)"

        Firewalls and proxies can inspect URLs for potentially known-bad domains or parameters. They can also do reputation-based analytics on websites and their requested resources such as how old a domain is, who it's registered to, if it's on a known bad list, or how many other users have connected to it before.

        Network intrusion detection systems, sometimes with SSL/TLS inspection, can be used to look for known malicious scripts (recon, heap spray, and browser identification scripts have been frequently reused), common script obfuscation, and exploit code.

        Detecting compromise based on the drive-by exploit from a legitimate website may be difficult. Also look for behavior on the endpoint system that might indicate successful compromise, such as abnormal behavior of browser processes. This could include suspicious files written to disk, evidence of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) for attempts to hide execution, evidence of Discovery, or other unusual network traffic that may indicate additional tools transferred to the system.

      description: |-
        Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a cloud account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. In some cases, cloud accounts may be federated with traditional identity management systems, such as Windows Active Directory.(Citation: AWS Identity Federation)(Citation: Google Federating GC)(Citation: Microsoft Deploying AD Federation)

        Compromised credentials for cloud accounts can be used to harvest sensitive data from online storage accounts and databases. Access to cloud accounts can also be abused to gain Initial Access to a network by abusing a [Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199). Similar to [Domain Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002), compromise of federated cloud accounts may allow adversaries to more easily move laterally within an environment.

        Once a cloud account is compromised, an adversary may perform [Account Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098) - for example, by adding [Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003) - to maintain persistence and potentially escalate their privileges.

      name: Spearphishing via Service
      description: "Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services
        in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via service
        is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of
        spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than
        directly via enterprise email channels. \n\nAll forms of spearphishing are
        electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual,
        company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through
        various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise
        controlled services. These services are more likely to have a less-strict
        security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the
        goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in
        some way. Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees
        for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking
        about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment. The
        adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.\n\nA
        common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send
        content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer.
        This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account,
        and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were
        expecting. If the payload doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue
        normal communications and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working."

      x_mitre_detection: "Because most common third-party services used for spearphishing

        detection signatures or other security gateway appliances may be able to detect
        malware. \n\nAnti-virus can potentially detect malicious documents and files
        that are downloaded on the user's computer. Endpoint sensing or network sensing
        can potentially detect malicious events once the file is opened (such as a
        Microsoft Word document or PDF reaching out to the internet or spawning Powershell.exe)
